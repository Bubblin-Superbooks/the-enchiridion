<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>XVII</h3><p class="  start-chapter">Remember that you are an actor in a drama of such sort as the Author chooses—if short, then in a short one; if long,   then in a long one. If it be his pleasure that you should enact a poor man, or a cripple, or a ruler, or a private citizen, see that you act it well. For this is your business—to act well the given part, but to choose it belongs to another.</p></div> </div>
